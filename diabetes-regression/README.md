# Diabetes Regression using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates a regression problem where the goal is to predict a continuous disease progression score.

## Dataset
- sklearn Diabetes dataset
- Target variable is numeric (regression)

## Approach
- Train/test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Linear Regression model
- Evaluation using MSE, RMSE, and R² score

## Results
- RMSE ≈ 54
- R² ≈ 0.45

## Learnings
- Difference between regression and classification
- Understanding RMSE and R²
- Regression predictions are approximate, not exact
